                    <h1 id="history">History</h1>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The following is personal history and opinion.</p>
<hr />
<p>I developed Phpactor because I am a VIM (and Linux console) user, and every year
that passed (there were many of them) I noticed that the relative stupidity of
my editor grew more and more as IDEs such as Jetbrains
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a> and Idea platforms offered more
and more great features.</p>
<p>VIM is a great text editor, but it is essentially ignorant of the meaning of
code. Nevertheless, I still <em>felt</em> that I could program faster and more
efficiently in VIM running in <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">Tmux</a>
sessions in a minimal tiling desktop environment such as
<a href="https://i3wm.org/">I3</a>. I became extremely good at typing, and developed
muscle memory for class constructors and properties.</p>
<p>Not having these refactoring tools however also meant that the lack of them would
have a direct influence on the quality of my code and architecture (if would
take an hour to move a bunch of classes, the chances are I probably wouldn't do
that).</p>
<p>Of course there were a multitude of ways to mitigate this lack of functionality
and for some time I had, for example, been using ctags completion (basically
regexy &quot;dumb&quot; completion) and code snippet generators, but a real
contextually aware code completion and refactoring tool for PHP was simply not
available.</p>
<p>I was excited to find out about projects like
<a href="https://github.com/padawan-php/padawan.php">Padawan</a> and other similar
efforts, but they all seemed either unstable or sub-optimal (at the time at
least) and after a while I thought &quot;how hard can it be&quot;? So in 2014 I wrote the
first version of Phpactor. It was failed. 1 year later I wrote another, it
sucked. The ongoing third effort is what we have here today.</p>
<p>One of the things that made Phpactor possible was the Microsoft <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/tolerant-php-parser">Tolerant PHP
parser</a> (TPP), a great library
which offers a practical and fast AST. At this time I also discovered the
Microsoft Language Server protocol, and Felix Beckers <a href="https://github.com/felixfbecker/php-language-server">PHP Language
Server</a>. This was awkward
as the language server was a solid effort and the overlap between it and
Phpactor was apparent. But I decided to carry on - I had previously waited for
other projects and they didn't mature.</p>
<p>Initially I also used the <a href="https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser">Nickic PHP
parser</a> - the defacto PHP parser in the
PHP world today, but I found the TPP much easier to work with as it
provides node tree-traversal (and was matched to Phpactor's use case - I <em>believe</em>
it was Initially created to support the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">VS
Code</a> eco-system.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that the backbone of Phpactor is
<a href="https://github.com/phpactor/worse-reflection">worse-reflection</a>, which was
influenced by <a href="https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection">BetterReflection</a>. BetterReflection
is an awesome project by the <a href="https://roave.com/">Roave</a> team to provide a static
alternative to the SPL Reflection library. Initially Phpactor used this
library, but as Phpactor had different requirements, it would have been
painfully slow progress to incrementally contribute the experimental functionality. worse-reflection
has gone through many iterations and continues to be unstable, it is the core
domain of Phpactor and is subservient to its needs.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-php-language-server">Why not PHP Language Server?</h2>
<p>No reason - PHP language server is great. But there are some differentiators:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phpactor is realtime</strong>: It does not index anything. This is both good and
bad, good because it is fast (depending on the operation), doesn't suffer
from memory issues and has no start-up penalty. It uses short lived
processes, which is what PHP is classically good at. We locate files quickly
by depending on the <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> autoloader. Bad
because it cannot discover non-autoloadable classes or (at time of writing)
provide completion for functions in the wild. Phpactor still works without
composer by traversing your project tree, but it's speed is then relative to
project size.</li>
<li><strong>Phpactor is also a refactoring tool</strong>: Phpactor provides
<a href="refactorings.html">refactorings</a> and procedures to help you code faster and
more accurately (such as complete constructor, generate method, implement
contracts etc).</li>
<li><strong>Phpactor ships with a VIM plugin</strong>: Phpactor ships with a <a href="vim-plugin.html">VIM plugin</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-not-language-server-protocol">Why not Language Server Protocol?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol">Language Server
Protocol</a> defines a
standard protocol for an editor to talk to a language server. Phpactor is
fills the role of a language server, but it's essentially a PHP script.</p>
<p>Phpactor currently implements its own <a href="rpc.html">RPC Protocol</a>, this at least
gives it flexibility. But it would be great to eventually either replace this
with LSP or provide an LSP interface and therefore be a generic backend for
all editors with LSP support.</p>
